## Description

The Minimal Work Day planner is a planner application with clean feature for ease of use and reliability. 

The features of this application are the following:

- Current time display for accurate scheduling

- Color code to easily identify past, future and present time blocks

- Quick Save feature to lock in you scheduled times




## Challenges :ocean:

 - **I had trouble with designing the layout of the application. I wanted to use jquery to clone the columns/rows but I couldn't figure it out.**

## Conslusion :tornado:

Another challenging assignment. I learned that having a solid overall understanding is key, as of now I'm still confused with many concepts. I also learned that I need to be patient, and understand that it's going to take sometime for this material to click.
